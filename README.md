# The AmpleForthGold Project  

Synthetic Gold forged using Ampleforth technology.

## Project Goals
AmpleForthGold is a decentralized elastic supply protocol based on the [*Ampleforth/uFragments*](https://github.com/ampleforth/uFragments) Implementation. It maintains a stable unit price in gold by adjusting supply directly to and from wallet holders. For a complete description of the protocol and the rationale behind the project, you can read [**the Gold Paper**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmpleForthGold/AmpleForthGold/master/TheGoldPaper.pdf).

## Key Dates
### 2020/08/25 Initial Token sale, initial liquidity available.
On the above date, AmpleForthGold tokens will be available for purchase. Initial liquidity will go live on [*UniSwap*](https://uniswap.org/) on 25th August 2020. This will be 10% of the AAU tokens in existence. The tokens will not be rebased initially and will be freely available to all. Read [**the Gold Paper**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmpleForthGold/AmpleForthGold/master/TheGoldPaper.pdf) for details on the distribution of tokens. 

Exact time shall be 12:12am NZST on 25th August 2020.

### 2020/09/15 The Rebasement begins
Rebasement of the AAU tokens to the price of one ounce of Gold shall begin. This shall affect the quantity of token you hold, but does not affect the percentage of the market cap you hold. See the original [*Ampleforth Whitepaper*](https://www.ampleforth.org/papers/) for details.
### 2020/10/15 Midas Launches
Most (90%+) AmpleForthGold tokens will (eventually) be distributed to the holders of AmpleForthGold tokens via Midas. Read [**the Gold Paper**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmpleForthGold/AmpleForthGold/master/TheGoldPaper.pdf) for details on Midas and the distribution of tokens.
