### Introduction

We believe in the novel [Ampleforth](http://ampleforth.org) stable coin. However, it may be noted that a valued physical commodity (not a fiat currency) should be the foundation of any stable coin. On that note, we believe gold best suits this purpose. In the light of this simple idea the [AmpleForth.Gold](http://ampleforth.gold) project has been formed.

### Why Gold?
Unlike fiat currencies that come and go, gold has been around throughout written history as a means of exchange and a store of value. While its prices can fluctuate, precious metals like gold will always maintain its value. 

> <p>"Our view is that gold is only appropriate if you have a very strong view that the U.S. dollar is going to be debased. We don’t have that view. We think the dollar maintains its status as the reserve currency. The dollar can cheapen a little bit because it’s moderately overvalued but that doesn’t mean that it’s going to be debased, that we are going to have huge inflation and that gold is a good substitute."<br><br> - CIO Goldman Sachs, 6th August 2020.</p>

We disagree with Goldman Sachs view. It is apparent that due to abuse of the printing press at the US federal reserve we are indeed on the cusp of substantial US$ debasement event and the associated inflation. The core idea behind AmpleForthGold is to provide a safe haven for the stable and valued commodity which is Gold.   

### The AAU Ticker Symbol
The [AmpleForth.Gold](http://ampleforth.gold) project shall use [**AAU**](http://ampleforth.gold) as it's ticker symbol on exchanges such as [UniSwap](https://uniswap.org/). [**AAU**](http://ampleforth.gold) is synonymous with [AmpleForth.Gold](http://ampleforth.gold)

### Project Goals
1. Support the original [Ampleforth](http://ampleforth.org) project.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The [**AAU**](http://ampleforth.gold) project can only succeed if the original [Ampleforth](http://ampleforth.org) project succeeds. It is in this projects best interest to support and help the original [Ampleforth](http://ampleforth.org) project to succeed and grow. Their success is our success.</p>
2. Provide a new implementation of the original [Ampleforth](http://ampleforth.org) project that uses gold oracles.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>The original [Ampleforth](http://ampleforth.org) project uses US$ oracles to maintain the price of the [Ampleforth](http://ampleforth.org) Token at approximately US$1. We shall replace this oracle to use [**ChainLink**](https://defi.chain.link/) Gold oracles based on the GOLD exchange rate (the price of one ounce of Gold at rebasement time). By using this we have a token that is priced in gold but is not linked to the US$ or any other (unstable) fiat currency.</p>
3. Otherwise use the process and procedures of the original Ampleforth project.
    * Where possible re-use the original Ampleforth implementation.
    * Only make changes that are consistent with the project goals.
    * Keep all changes to a minimum.
    * Continually re-merge changes from the original Ampleforth project GitHub back into this project's GitHub.
    * Functionally re-use the [*Ampleforth Geyser*](https://www.ampleforth.org/dapps/) to distribute AmpleForth.Gold tokens. The Geyser shall be renamed to **'Midas'**.  
4. Register the [**AAU**](http://ampleforth.gold) token intially with UniSwap, Coinbase Wallet and Metamask.

### Initial Coin Distribution
We do not believe in pre-mining, distributing coins to developers, founders or investors. We would like to distribute this coin to the masses as fairly as possible. To accomplish this the following distribution strategy shall be followed:

1. The founders shall provide $10,000.00 USD of ETH to this project to provide initial market liquidity. This will be matched with 10% of the total supply of [**AAU**](http://ampleforth.gold) and placed in Uniswap as initial liquidity. The initial quantity of [**AAU**](http://ampleforth.gold) tokens shall match the Gold price on the day that liquidity is provided.
2. The [*Ampleforth Geyser*](https://www.ampleforth.org/dapps/) shall be re-used and renamed **Midas**. **Midas** shall be gifted 90% of tokens once liqidity has been provided. **Midas** shall distribute those tokens and provide enhanced market liquidity. **Midas** shall distribute based on the percentage of the pool that each depositor provides. The following rules shall apply:
    * **Midas** shall distribute 0.5% of its total tokens each day. This implies that the frequency of distribution would occur as follows:
       * Approximately 3.4% of tokens would be distributed in the first week. 
       * Approximately 14% of tokens would be distributed in the first month. 
       * Approximately 58% of tokens would be distributed in the first 6 months. 
       * Approximately 83% of tokens would be distributed in the first year. 
       * Approximately 96% of tokens would be distributed within the first 2 years. 
       * Approximately 98% of tokens would be distributed within the first 3 years.     
    * **Midas** shall distribute [**AAU**](http://ampleforth.gold) to all depositors equally. However, to encourage holding and provide liquidity, some deposit holders shall be more equal than others. Specifically:
       * Accounts holding for more then 7 days shall have a 10% bonus.
       * Accounts holding for more then 28 days shall have a 20% bonus.
       * Accounts holding for more then 168 days shall have a 30% bonus.
       * Accounts holding for more then 365 days shall have a 50% bonus.
3. Once **Midas** has distributed more than 10% of the [**AAU**](http://ampleforth.gold) tokens, and the available liquidity in [**UniSwap**](https://uniswap.org/) exceeds 15% of the total [**AAU**](http://ampleforth.gold) tokens, the founders shall remove their 10% of liquidity in a staggered process: They shall remove the liquidity in 5 equal transactions spread equally over 5 months. The founders shall gift all [**AAU**](http://ampleforth.gold) tokens from this event to **Midas** for distribution. The founders shall keep their initial ETH deposit.

### The founders
 
The founders shall not be gifted any equity stake in this project (no pre-mine) as all [**AAU**](http://ampleforth.gold) tokens shall (eventually) be distributed by **Midas**. The founders hope that (just like bitcoin) the first users and first supporters of this project has the opportunity to profit from it. 

The founders have decided to remain anonymous for various legal, geographical, personal, and political reasons.
