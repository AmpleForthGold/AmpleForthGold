# The AmpleForthGold Project  

Synthetic Gold Using Ampleforth Technology.

## Project Goals
AmpleForthGold is a decentralized elastic supply protocol based on the [*Ampleforth/uFragments*](https://github.com/ampleforth/uFragments) Implementation. It maintains a stable unit price by adjusting supply directly to and from wallet holders. You can read [**the Gold Paper**](https://github.com/AmpleForthGold/AmpleForthGold/blob/master/GoldPaper.md) for the motivation and a complete description of the protocol.

## Contracts
This repository is a collection of smart contracts that implement the AmpleForthGold protocol on the Ethereum blockchain.
