# The AmpleForthGold Project  

Synthetic Gold Using Ampleforth Technology.

## Project Goals
[**The Gold Paper.**](https://github.com/AmpleForthGold/AmpleForthGold/blob/master/GoldPaper.md)

AmpleForthGold (aka uFragments) is a decentralized elastic supply protocol. It maintains a stable unit price by adjusting supply directly to and from wallet holders. You can read [**The Gold Paper.**](https://github.com/AmpleForthGold/AmpleForthGold/blob/master/GoldPaper.md) for the motivation and a complete description of the protocol.
